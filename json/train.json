        "review": "the game is fun, but only till the first chapter. in the second one, you'll soon run out of cars unless you don't spend money on the game. the multiplayer is also fair only till silver 4, after that, if in case you're an f2p and don't have cars, trial cars won't do you any good, you'll face opponents over 1.2k above your own car's rank knocking you down everytime. so yeah, it's very tough to advance in the game as an f2p, unless ofc you've been playing asphalt 9 since its release.",
